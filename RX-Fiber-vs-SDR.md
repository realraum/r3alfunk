# Comparing RFoF to remote SDR RX
Comparison on requirements and possibilities using RFoF or a remote SDR receiver.


- Fiber:
    - RX site may have slightly higher than ideal QRM (Lustb√ºhel? Inffeldgasse roof?)
    - low latency and direct spectrum access is worth not having ideal RX conditions

- Network / remote SDR RX
    - RX site should have lowest possible QRM, network is much easire available than dark fiber
    - Latency should be very low (optimizing software is necessary)
    - Network connection should be exclusive or at least better than LTE (direct WiFi link? 0xFF?)
